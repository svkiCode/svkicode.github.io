Why hello there! 
 
It's been quite a long time since I've been here, and it feels like just about everything has changed since. My understanding of myself, my interests, the people around me, my attitude about so much..   
 
Some of the bad has been that I ended up getting really burnt out, especially on tech stuff, and lost a fair amount of confidence, both making it hard to return to this, *but...* some really good things happened too!! 
 
 
Since my last post I...   
 
	- started HRT & came out IRL   
	- learned to be kind to myself   
	- learned a lot more about who I am, like being ace-spec, aro-spec, nonbinary, and autistic   
	- made a bunch of new friends I love who've helped me grow and changed my life in so many loving ways I couldn't begin to explain it in this post   
	- and lastly, found photography, which has allowed me to express myself creatively for the first time in a long time   
 
 
That last point especially I'd like to note on. When I started this blog, my biggest interests were programming, electronics, cyberdecks, and generally anything tech-related.   
   
Since about late 2019 my biggest special interest became photography, and in particular film photography, and then around august 2020 I got my first DSLR, which really set things into motion.  ^^
